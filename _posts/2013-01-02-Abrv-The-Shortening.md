title: Abrv - The Shortening
---

Old-school text-messaging led to the abbreviation of language. 4 eg u can read this :-)

But some common technology terminology is still spoken in long-form. And when mainstream media highlight a website, they sometimes use a lot of syllables. For example; telling folks to link to this website would sound like:
* h-t-t-p-co-lon-for-ward-slash-for-ward-slash-dou-ble-u-dou-ble-u-dou-ble-u-dou-ble-u-dot-blog-ger-dot-com

29 syllables; most of them protocol; only 4 of them (14%) are site specific.

# Proposal

So, I propose a verbal shortening for some common web words:
* http = hittip
* www = dubtrip
* forward-slash = frash

Audibly this website then becomes:
* hit-tip-co-lon-frash-frash-dub-trip-dot-blog-ger-dot-com

13 syllables; halving the spoken wordage.

Other tech terms could also be shortened:
* back-slash = blash
* hash-tag = tash
* IPv4 = IP4 (we don't refer to Windows v8 or Mac iOS vX)
* IPv6 = IP6

Every syllable counts! (Save time = save energy)

# Thumbs Up

[frash](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=frash) and [blash](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blash) are already listed in [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/); but I've added these technology terms as alternate meanings. Feel free to give them thumbs up (no login required).
