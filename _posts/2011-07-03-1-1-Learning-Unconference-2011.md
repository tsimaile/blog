title: 1:1 Learning Unconference 2011
---

Over 21/22 June 2011 the 1:1 Learning Unconference was held in Sydney and promoted to help NSW teachers implement the Digital Education Revolution in their schools. Although interested when I first heard about the event, I dismissed it as too expensive for school funds to cover considering the cost of transport and accommodation. But [Ross Woolfe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-woolfe-68171494/) from the Lismore Education Office offered an invite which I was happy to jump at.

An unconference is participant-driven, with pre-event surveys determining what would be presented, and by whom. I was fortunate to be able to present:
* Showcase: ~~Video Conferencing and Moodle~~
* Micro Learning Session: ~~Painting Animation with Photoshop~~

The conveners, [Ben Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benpaddlejones/) and [Pip Cleaves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pipcleaves/), demonstrated the use of digital resources during registration and preparation, providing wikispace and cloud documents, sending SMS and emails to encourage and inspire, and encouraging discussion and interaction via [twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%231to1unconf), ~~liveblog~~ and [flicker](http://www.flickr.com/photos/64285039@N04).

A huge benefit from this event was the chance to meet some mentors face-to-face, and discuss ideas freely and fluidly. An atmosphere of sharing encompassed the venue, and participants moved between discussions, showcases, and micro learning sessions building new concepts and relationships.

## Benefits

* Pip Cleaves (DERNSW) and others demonstrated presentation format Pecha-Kucha â€“ 20 slides at 20 seconds each
* [Paul Ganderton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpaulganderton/) (Sydney Boys High School) showed benefits of using Moodle blogs to encourage students to contribute and collaborate
* [Glynis Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glynis-jones-0b12aa8/) (UTS) described how to use reflective blog to evaluate video conference learning from student viewpoint
* [Matthew Kearney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkearneypost/) (UTS) expressed interest in demonstrating video conference learning with pre-service teachers
* Ben Jones (DERNSW) discussed the use of ePortfolios for scaffolding, aggregating, and archiving project work

* Alisa Williams (Braidwood Central School) showcased Edmodo as a social media for distribution and communication within the classroom

On return to Lismore (via train due to grounded flights) a pecha-kucha outlining the benefits of the unconference was presented to Ross Woolfe. This will also be presented to Kadina High staff on 18-Jul-2011.
