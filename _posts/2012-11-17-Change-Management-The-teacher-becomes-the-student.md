title: Change Management - The teacher becomes the student
---

After [teaching](https://tsimaile.github.io/blog/Achievements-Unlocked-Leveling-up/) high school students about computer hardware and programming languages for 20 years I am now practicing what I preached!

This week I started working as a [Senior Technical Support Officer](https://www.scu.edu.au/about/contacts/staff-directory/staff/34442.php) in the Administrative Systems team of [Southern Cross University](http://www.scu.edu.au/). I'm learning about managing system environments, modifying and applying upgrades to corporate software, and providing advice and operational support to clients for Corporate Services applications and other related systems.

Conceptually I understand what is happening, but learning the nitty-gritty details will take time. Fortunately, one of my tasks is to update and develop documentation, so I have time to delve into the details. And to put the theory from the classroom into practice is very exciting! A highlight was a guided tour by one of the Senior IT Admins into the corporate data-centre.

Leaving the high school system has meant a change of environment, and work practice. It has also meant moving from blogED to [blogspot](http://tsimaile.blogspot.com.au/); I assume my DEC account will be disabled, and at end-of-year when blogED is [archived](https://tsimaile.github.io/blog/Q-To-blogEd-Or-Not-To-blogEd/) I will be unable to access the content (and drafts).

Getting content into blogger was not as easy as I expected. Text, image, and video data was fine, but using tables with CSS had specific quirks, requiring some fine-tuning. And tracking down some of the original content for some posts took some time.

In future I'm considering how to incorporate an audio edition (podcast) to blog posts; just need a convenient way to implement [RSS](https://tsimaile.github.io/blog/Mass-media-How-RSS-aggregates-ReSourceS/). Things will continue to change ...
