Next year I'll be [transferring](/Nominated-Transfer-Five-Stages-of-Grief/) to another school. With this change I've had cause to pause and consider what I've achieved with my time at my current school; what I've learnt and what I'm proud of. Here's a selection of highlights ...

Thank you to the many staff and students who have helped me unlock these and other achievements. (If I missed anyone, my apologies; let me know and I'll update this post.)

I look forward to finding and unlocking many more achievements at my new school.
