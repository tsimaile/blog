title: Feasibility of Web-based Data Management Systems
---

**Should time and resources be allocated to investigate the implementation of web-based data management solutions through-out the school site/community?**

# Nutshell

Presently our educational institution (site) outlays annual license fees to a number of software vendors to use products such as TimeChart, RISC, and ReportCard for administrative data management. These products cannot be directly used on DER devices as application installation is prohibited on these devices.

However, alternative web-based products and services which perform similar functions may reduce annual license fees, and enable staff to access and manage teaching resources and administrative data globally from any web-enabled computer.
